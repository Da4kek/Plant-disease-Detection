# Citrus Disease and Pest Detection Project

Welcome to the Citrus Disease and Pest Detection project repository! This project aims to develop a robust classification system for detecting citrus diseases and pests using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) integrated with neurofuzzy logic.

## Project Overview

Citrus diseases and pests pose significant threats to citrus crop yield and quality worldwide. Early detection and intervention are essential for effective disease and pest management. In this project, we leverage machine learning techniques to develop an accurate and efficient system for identifying and classifying citrus diseases and pests based on image data.

## Modules

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- The `EDA.ipynb` notebook provides an in-depth exploration of the dataset.
- This module focuses on understanding the characteristics of the dataset, including image distributions, class distributions, and potential challenges in data preprocessing.

### 2. CNN with Neurofuzzy Logic

- This module will involve the development and implementation of a CNN-based classification system integrated with neurofuzzy logic.
- The system will be trained to classify images of citrus leaves into different disease and pest categories.
- Neurofuzzy logic will be used to enhance the classification accuracy and interpretability of the model.

## Dataset

- The dataset folder contains the dataset downloaded from the [Kaggle site.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathansilva2020/dataset-for-classification-of-citrus-diseases)
- The dataset consists of a collection of images depicting citrus leaves affected by various diseases and pests.
- Participants are encouraged to explore the dataset and preprocess the images as needed for model training and evaluation.

## Instructions for Participants

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the `EDA.ipynb` notebook to gain insights into the dataset.
3. Familiarize yourself with the dataset structure and image contents.
4. Develop and implement CNN models integrated with neurofuzzy logic for disease and pest classification.
5. Evaluate the performance of your models using appropriate metrics and techniques.
6. Collaborate with other participants to integrate individual solutions into a unified classification system.
